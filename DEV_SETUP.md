## Git Issue History & Resolution

### Problem (December 30, 2024)
Previous Git for Windows installation was incomplete - missing `git.exe` executables.

### Root Cause
Corrupted/partial Git installation at `C:\Program Files\Git\` that only contained helper tools (`gitk.exe`, `git-gui.exe`) but not the main `git.exe`.

### Solution Applied
1. Uninstalled incomplete Git installation
2. Fresh install of Git for Windows from https://git-scm.com/download/win
3. Selected "Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software" during install
4. Restarted VS Code to pick up new PATH

### Verification Commands
```cmd
where git
git --version
flutter doctor
```

Expected output:
- `where git` → `C:\Program Files\Git\cmd\git.exe`
- `git --version` → `git version 2.52.0.windows.1`
- `flutter doctor` → `[✓] Flutter (Channel stable, 3.38.5, ...)`

---

## Important: Session Refresh After Git Changes

**CRITICAL**: If Git is reinstalled or PATH is modified:
1. **Close VS Code completely** (not just the terminal)
2. **Reopen VS Code**
3. Open a new terminal and verify with `git --version`

Terminals inherit PATH at launch time. They don't automatically pick up environment variable changes.

---

## Development Paths

| Tool | Location |
|------|----------|
| Git | `C:\Program Files\Git\cmd\git.exe` |
| Flutter | `C:\Flutter\flutter\bin\flutter` |
| Dart SDK | `C:\Flutter\flutter\bin\cache\dart-sdk` |
| Android SDK | `C:\Users\seanm\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk` |
| Java (JDK) | `C:\Program Files\Eclipse Adoptium\jdk-17.0.17.10-hotspot` |

---

## Running the App

```cmd
flutter run
```

**Controls while running:**
- `r` - Hot reload
- `R` - Hot restart
- `q` - Quit

---

## Troubleshooting

### "git is not recognized"
1. Verify Git is installed: Check `C:\Program Files\Git\cmd\git.exe` exists
2. Verify PATH: Run `echo %PATH%` and look for `C:\Program Files\Git\cmd`
3. Restart VS Code completely

### "Dart SDK not found"
1. Run `flutter doctor` - it will auto-download the Dart SDK
2. If still failing, run `flutter clean` then `flutter pub get`

### Flutter cache corruption
```cmd
flutter clean
rd /s /q C:\Flutter\flutter\bin\cache
flutter doctor
```
This will re-download all Flutter dependencies.

## GitHub Desktop Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Can't find Football-IQ" or ENOENT Error

**Symptoms:**
- GitHub Desktop shows "Can't find [repository name]"
- Error message: `ENOENT: Git failed to execute. This can occur...`
- Repository appears grayed out or missing

**Root Cause:**
GitHub Desktop sometimes loses its reference to local repositories, especially after:
- Moving the project folder
- Git reinstallation
- PATH environment changes
- Windows updates

**Solutions:**

#### Option 1: Relocate the Repository
1. In GitHub Desktop, click "Locate..." button
2. Navigate to your project folder (e.g., `C:\Users\seanm\Projects\Football-IQ`)
3. Select the folder and click "Select Folder"

#### Option 2: Re-add the Repository
1. File → Add Local Repository
2. Browse to your project folder
3. Click "Add repository"

#### Option 3: Use Command Line (Most Reliable)
When GitHub Desktop fails, git command line still works:
```cmd
cd C:\Users\seanm\Projects\Football-IQ
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push
```

#### Option 4: Fresh GitHub Desktop Install
1. Uninstall GitHub Desktop
2. Delete `%APPDATA%\GitHub Desktop` folder
3. Reinstall from https://desktop.github.com/

**Important:** Git command line operations always work even when GitHub Desktop has issues. Don't let GUI problems stop your progress!

## Flutter Commands Reference

### Daily Development Commands

```cmd
# Check everything is working
flutter doctor

# Get/update dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run the app (will auto-detect devices)
flutter run

flutter build appbundle

# Build with verbose output (for debugging)
flutter build appbundle --verbose
```

### Key Design Patterns

**1. StatefulWidget with Animation**
```dart
class MyScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  State<MyScreen> createState() => _MyScreenState();
}

class _MyScreenState extends State<MyScreen>
    with SingleTickerProviderStateMixin {  // For animations
  late AnimationController _controller;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _controller = AnimationController(
      duration: const Duration(milliseconds: 800),
      vsync: this,
    );
    _controller.forward();
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _controller.dispose();  // Always clean up!
    super.dispose();
  }
}
```

**2. SharedPreferences for Local Storage**
```dart
// Save data
final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
await prefs.setInt('best_score', 10);

// Load data
final bestScore = prefs.getInt('best_score') ?? 0;
```

**3. Singleton Services**
```dart
class AnalyticsService {
  static final AnalyticsService _instance = AnalyticsService._internal();
  factory AnalyticsService() => _instance;
  AnalyticsService._internal();
}
```

## Common Errors & Solutions

### 1. "Dart SDK not found"
**Solution:**
```cmd
flutter doctor      # Auto-downloads SDK
flutter clean
flutter pub get
```

### 2. "pub get failed"
**Possible causes:**
- Network issues → Check internet connection
- Corrupted cache → Run `flutter clean`
- Version conflicts → Check `pubspec.yaml` for compatible versions

### 3. "Could not find a file named 'pubspec.yaml'"
**Solution:** Make sure you're in the project root directory:
```cmd
cd C:\Users\seanm\Projects\Football-IQ
flutter pub get
```

### 4. Build fails with "Gradle error"
**Solution:**
```cmd
cd android
./gradlew clean
cd ..
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter build appbundle
```

### 5. "No connected devices"
**Solutions:**
1. Start Android emulator from Android Studio
2. Connect physical device with USB debugging enabled
3. Run `flutter devices` to verify detection

### 6. Hot reload not working
**Likely cause:** Structural code changes require hot restart (`R`) or full restart

### 7. "setState() called after dispose()"
**Solution:** Check `mounted` before setState:
```dart
if (mounted) {
  setState(() {
    // your state changes
  });
}
```

## Tips for Beginners

### 1. Start Simple, Iterate Often
Don't try to build everything at once. Get a basic version working, then add features one at a time.

### 2. Commit Frequently
Make small, focused commits. If something breaks, you can easily revert.
```cmd
git add .
git commit -m "Add score display to results screen"
```

### 3. Read Error Messages Carefully
Flutter error messages are usually helpful. Look for:
- The file and line number
- The actual error (often at the top)
- Suggested fixes (often at the bottom)

### 4. Use `flutter doctor` Liberally
When in doubt, run `flutter doctor`. It checks your entire setup.

### 5. Hot Reload is Your Friend
Press `r` constantly while developing UI. See changes instantly.

### 6. Don't Fear the Command Line
When GUIs fail (GitHub Desktop, Android Studio), the command line still works. Learn these basics:
- `cd` - change directory
- `git status` - see what's changed
- `flutter run` - run your app

### 7. Keep pubspec.yaml Clean
Only add dependencies you actually need. More packages = more potential conflicts.

### 8. Test on Real Devices
Emulators are convenient, but always test on real devices before publishing. Performance and behavior can differ.

### 9. Back Up Everything
- Use git for code
- Export your keystore file and store it safely (you need it for Play Store updates!)
- Document your API keys securely

### 10. When Stuck, Clean and Rebuild
90% of mysterious issues are fixed by:
```cmd
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```
