Initial Issue:
"Flutter CLI has a 'Git fork bomb' error - Flutter's PowerShell scripts
can't determine engine version. This blocks ALL builds."

Resolution:
After investigation and testing, Flutter is now working correctly:
- All Flutter commands execute successfully
- No Git fork bomb errors encountered
- Build system fully operational
- End-to-end workflow tested

Root Cause:
The issue appears to have been transient or related to environment state.
Flutter is now functioning properly with all standard commands.
